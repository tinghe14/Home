Welcome! I am a second-year PhD Candidate in the
[Biomedical Informatics and Data Sciences](http://dhsi.med.jhmi.edu/) 
at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). I am interested in natural 
language processing and big data with a focus on health-related topics. 

My research goals are to:
1. dig valuable information from unstructured data sets
2. help generate public to better utilize their health data 

More information can be found in my [CV](https://tinghe14.github.io/cv).
